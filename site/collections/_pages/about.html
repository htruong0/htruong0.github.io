        Hi there! I'm Henry Truong, a postgraduate researcher in the field of particle
        physics phenomenology.
        I'm enrolled in the Data Intensive CDT programme at Durham University where I have
        been investigating the use of machine learning to accelerate simulated particle
        collision events, a crucial part of the international Large Hadron collider experiment.
      </p>
     
      <p>
        My thesis is focused on applying deep neural networks to emulate expressions depicting
        scattering probabilities in order to accelerate the simulation process. I have published
        three papers on this subject. I have shown that speed-ups of factors of 10000 are
        achievable in ideal settings and over factors of 100 in more realistic production pipelines.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some other projects I've worked on during my PhD include: an epidemiology model investigating
        the spread of an infectious disease across individuals in a digital twin of England built upon
        Office for National Statistics data; and an image post-processing pipeline for enhancing the
        fidelity of medical x-ray images. You can read more about these on <a href="/projects">my projects page</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am interested in applying my modelling, data analysis, and data visualisation skills
        obtained during my doctoral studies to contribute to a team working on practical challenges.
      </p>
